## My Tools
Tools are in early state & will be updated frequently.

- [LOC]() - coming soon

  Lines of code compiled from [Rust LOC]() and enhanced a bit.

- [LSW-PDB2EX](tools/LSW-pdbex.7z)

  Generates JSON from PDB

 - [LSW ScintillaPad](tools/LSW-ScintillaPad.7z)

   Standalone Editor

  - [LSW Winfile](tools/LSW-WinFile.7z)

    Enhanced Version of Microsoft's WinFile.


    **Winfile-win1903.exe** requires Win10 Version 1903 because it contains a hard coded binding to the new PseudoConsole.

    **Winfile-win1903.exe** allows to run Console programs which redirects automatically to the Scintilla Window.

    I plan also to add a [MS-Chakra](https://github.com/microsoft/ChakraCore) based JS-Runtime in Form of a WinFile Addon.
